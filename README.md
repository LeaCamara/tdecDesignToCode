Used a jpeg webpage design as a mock-up example to create a single working web page using: 
- hand-coded HTML and CSS, and 
- responsive code based on viewport width. 

Ideas for Next Iteration:
- Use flexbox for all the containers.
- Using flexbox, create more modular sections that are easier to move around, change the order, etc., when designing for different screen sizes.
- For phones, put the sidebar content after the hero area, at the bottom of the page.
- For tablets, put the sidebar content underneath the hero image on the left, or possibly line the articles up horizontally across the bottom, just above the footer, like a horizontal menu of additional articles.# tdecDesignToCode
